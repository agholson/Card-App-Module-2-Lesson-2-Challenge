This app represents a deck of cards, where you can add cards to the deck, and pull cards out of the deck. It is a tutorial app built by following CodeWithChris's 
amazing iOS Foundations course. In particular it is in response to the challenge app in the 
[iOS Foundations UISwift Module 2 Lesson 2](https://learn.codewithchris.com/courses/take/foundations/texts/19273518-lesson-2-challenge).
